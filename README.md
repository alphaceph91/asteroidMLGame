# Asteroid Machine Learning Game
AsteroidMLGame is a python based game consisting of a spaceship and asteroids. The spaceship is controlled by a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent. The spaceship must navigate through an asteroid field. The agent learns to dodge asteroids and fire heat-seeking missiles to destroy them based on the astroids trajectory and close proximity to the spaceship. The project is built using [PyGame] (https://github.com/pygame/pygame), [PyTorch] (https://pytorch.org/) and standard Python libraries. The game is trained and tested for Linux.
